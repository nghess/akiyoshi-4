The term fractal describes a class of irregular curves or shapes for which any suitably chosen part is similar in shape to a given larger or smaller part when magnified or reduced to the same size. Fractal properties are found throughout the natural and manmade world. The series of animations you saw today displayed animated fractal patterns of a varying complexity.</p><p class=""debrief""><strong>Purpose of this study:</strong> We hope to better understand how the perception of static fractals differs from the perception of animated fractals, and how the speed of the animated patterns influences people&apos;s perception of them. Fractals allow us to study the perception of aesthetic properties (e.g. the perceived level of beauty in an image) without using recognizable content, which makes them an excellent tool for studying abstract aesthetic judgement.</p><p class=""debrief""><strong>Your part:</strong> Your participation has helped us to further understand how humans perceive these patterns across different levels of speed and complexity. This research with allow us to better understand how the visual system and brain process our ever-changing visual environments.<p class=""debrief""><strong>Feedback and Further information:</strong> If you have additional questions about this study, please feel free to ask the researcher, Nathan Gonzales-Hess at nhess @ uoregon.edu.
